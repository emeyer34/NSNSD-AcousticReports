Abstract
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
This study arose from the `r (park)` (`r (pcode)`) **~Example Text: Resource Stewardship Strategy (RSS), which identified the need for baseline acoustic surveys in the park. Short-term natural soundscape RSS goals were to identify the condition of the acoustic resource, and the high priority stewardship activity associated with this goal was to collect baseline acoustic data**. Therefore, across `r (season_count)` season(s) from `r (datayear1)` **to `r (datayear2)`**, the Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD) gathered acoustical data at `r (sitenum)` sites in `r (pcode)` to provide park managers with information about the acoustical environment, sources of noise, and the existing ambient sound levels within the park. **~On average, noise was present from 7 to 85 percent of the time across the six sites. The most common sources of noise were vehicles, aircraft, and people.  The maximum percent time audible for any detailed noise source was people at site `r (pcode)`00X, audible for 81 % of a 24-hr period. Aircraft was most audible at site `r (pcode)`00X (15%), and vehicles were most audible at site `r (pcode)`00X (20%). Overall, existing ambient sound levels (L~A50~) at sites within `r (pcode)` ranged from 17.8 – 31.1 dB during the day and 15.6-34.0 dB at night during the sampling period. Natural ambient sound levels (L~Anat~) at sites within `r (pcode)` ranged from 16.4 – 30.0 dB during the day and 15.1-33.0 dB at night. The median impact, defined as the difference in dB between the L~A50~ and L~Anat~, was 1.4 dB. Noise impacts ranged from 1.1 dB at `r (pcode)`00X to 8.3 dB at `r (pcode)`00X, where noise was audible for 100 % of the time from 07:00 to 10:00.**

List of Terms or Acronyms
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
**A-weighting:** A-weighting is applied to sound levels to account for the sensitivity of the human ear (Harris, 1998). To approximate human hearing sensitivity, A-weighting discounts sounds below 1 kHz and above 6 kHz.

**Acoustic Environment:** A combination of all the physical sound resources within a given area. This includes natural sounds and cultural sounds, and non-natural human-caused sounds. The acoustic environment of a park can be divided into two main categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.

**Acoustic Resources:** Includes both natural sounds like wind, water, and wildlife and cultural and historic sounds like tribal ceremonies, quiet reverence, and battle reenactments.

**Amplitude:** The relative strength of a sound wave, described in decibels (dB). Amplitude is related to what we commonly call loudness or volume.

**ANS Weighting:** The Natural Sounds modification to A-weighting eliminates high-frequency sound (leaf rustle, equipment noise, and biologic sounds) allowing for more accurate comparisons of low-frequency ambient sound levels across different land use types (e.g., urban, protected areas; ANSI S3/SC1.100, 2014 [R2020]). This frequency weighting scheme improves ambient sound level measurements in quiet environments.

**Audibility:** The ability of animals with normal hearing, including humans, to hear a given sound. It can vary depending upon the frequency content and amplitude of sound and by hearing ability of individual animals.

**Decibel (dB):** A unit of sound energy. Sound levels are measured on a logarithmic scale relative to the reference sound pressure for atmospheric sources, 20 µPa. The logarithmic scale is a useful way to express the wide range of sound pressures perceived by the human ear. Every 10 dB increase represents a tenfold increase in energy. Therefore, a 20 dB increase represents a hundredfold increase in energy.

**Existing ambient sound level (~LA50~):** Sound level (L~Aeq,~~1s~) exceeded 50% of the time (50^th^ percentile) for a specified duration. This level is referred to as the existing ambient sound level and the preferred metric for chronic conditions, as it is insensitive to infrequent loud events.

**Frequency:** Related to the pitch of a sound, and defined as the number of times per second that the wave of sound repeats itself and is expressed in terms of hertz (Hz). Sound levels are often adjusted ("weighted") to match the hearing abilities of a given animal. In other words, different species of animals and humans are capable or hearing (or not hearing) at different frequencies. Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, and as low as 0 dB at 1,000 Hz. Bats, on the other hand, can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 200,000 Hz.

**Percentile sound levels (L~A10~, L~A50~, L~A90~):** Metrics used to describe A-weighted sound pressure levels (L), in decibels, exceeded 10, 50, and 90 percent of the time, respectively. Put another way, half the time the measured levels of sound are greater than the L~A50~ value, while 90 percent of the time the measured levels are higher than the L~A90~ value and 10 percent of the time measured levels are higher than the L~A10~ value.

**Day-Night average sound levels (L~dn~):** Average equivalent sound level over a 24-hour period, with a 10-dB penalty added for sound levels between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.

**Energy Equivalent Sound Level (L~Aeq~):** The sound energy level averaged over the measurement period. Generally, refers to A-weighted 1-second time averaged sound levels measured between 12.5 Hz - 20 kHz. This is a standard measurement collected using NSNSD acoustic monitoring protocol for sound level meters. Sound levels measured over 1 second intervals are used to calculate summary statistics, specifically percent of the time a sound level of interest is exceeded.

**Natural Ambient Sound Level (L~Anat~):** The natural sound conditions in parks, which would exist in the absence of any human-caused noise sources. L~Anat~ is the preferred metric to represent baseline or reference conditions.

**Noise Free Interval (NFI):** The length of the continuous period during which no human-caused sounds are audible.
Time Above: Within a defined period, the percent of the time sound levels (L~Aeq,~~1s~) are above a specified sound level (L~Aeq,~~1s~). Commonly used levels are 35, 45, 52 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~).

**Time Audible:** The amount of time that various sound sources are audible to humans with normal hearing, commonly expressed in percent of day, or percent of daytime hours and nighttime hours. A sound may be above natural ambient sound pressure levels, but still not audible. Similarly, some sounds that are below the natural ambient can be audible. Time Audible is useful because of its simplicity. It is a measure that correlates well with visitor complaints of excessive noise and annoyance. Most noise sources are audible to humans at lower levels than virtually all wildlife species. Therefore, time audible is a protective proxy for wildlife. These data can be collected either by a trained observer (on-site listening) or by making high-quality digital recordings for later playback (off-site listening).

**Sound Exposure Level (SEL):** The total sound energy of the actual sound during a specific time period. SEL is usually expressed using a time period of one second.

**Sound Pressure:** Minute change in atmospheric pressure due to passage of sound that can be detected by microphones.

**Sound vs. Noise:** Sound and noise are often used interchangeably to describe an acoustic source. A common definition of noise is unwanted sound or sounds that interfere with a signal of interest (Harris 1998; Templeton 1997). However, noise is not a purely subjective designation. Any sound that serves no function is noise. Most sounds produced by human transportation and other machinery are unintended and serve no function, therefore are noise regardless of the attitudes of the listener. While there are unintended sounds in nature, like the footfalls of an animal, these sounds provide vital cues for some receivers and are therefore considered sounds to the receiver, yet noise from the perception of the producer.

**Soundscape:** The human perception of physical sound resources.

Executive Summary
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
This report presents acoustical data gathered by the Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD) at `r (park)` (`r (pcode)`) across `r (season_count)` season(s) from `r (datayear1)` **~to `r (datayear2)`**. Data were collected at `r (sitenum)` sites (Figure 1) to provide park managers with information about the acoustical environment, sources of noise, and the existing ambient sound levels within the park. In these deployments, sound pressure level (SPL) was measured continuously every second by a calibrated sound level meter. Other equipment included an anemometer to collect wind speed and a digital audio recorder collecting continuous recordings to document sound sources. In this document, “sound pressure level” refers to broadband (12.5 Hz – 20,000 Hz), A-weighted, 1-second time averaged sound level (L~Aeq,~~1s~[12.5~–~20,000~Hz])~, and hereafter referred to as “sound level.” Sound levels are measured on a logarithmic scale relative to the reference sound pressure for atmospheric sources, 20 µPa. The logarithmic scale is a useful way to express the wide range of sound pressures perceived by the human ear. Sound levels are reported in decibels (dB). A-weighting is applied to sound levels to account for the response of the human ear (Harris, 1998). To approximate human hearing sensitivity, A-weighting discounts sounds below 1 kHz and above 6 kHz. For reference, Table 1 provides examples of sound levels measured in parks compared to sound levels of common sources.

Overall, existing ambient sound levels (L~A50~) at sites within `r (pcode)` ranged from **~17.8 – 31.1** dB during the day and **~15.6-34.0** dB at night during the sampling period. **~Table X** reports the percent of time that measured levels at the monitoring locations were above four key sound level values. The first value, 35 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), addresses the health effects of sleep interruption. Recent studies suggest that sound events as low as 35 dB can have adverse effects on blood pressure in sleeping humans (Haralabidis et al. 2008). This level, 35 dB, is also the desired background sound level in classrooms (ANSI S12.60-2002 [R2012]). The second value addresses the World Health Organization’s recommendations that noise levels inside bedrooms remain below 45 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~) (Berglund et al. 1999). The third value, 52 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), is based on the EPA’s speech interference level for speaking in a raised voice to an audience at 10 meters (EPA 1974). This value addresses the effects of sound on interpretive presentations in parks. The final value, 60 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), provides a basis for estimating speech interference on normal voice communications at 1 meter. Visitors viewing scenic areas in the park would likely be conducting such conversations. 

Sound levels are often measured over narrow frequency bands (typically in one-third octave bands between 12.5 Hz – 20 kHz) because these smaller bands closely represent how humans distinguish between frequencies of sound. In this study, we examine how often sound levels exceeded key values in two frequency ranges. The top value in each split-cell of **~Table X** uses the full frequency range (12.5 Hz – 20 kHz) collected, whereas the bottom value focuses on frequencies affected by low frequency noise sources (20 – 1,250 Hz). This Natural Sounds modification to A-weighting ((referred to as A-weighted Natural Sounds (ANS) weighting, ASA/ANSI S3/SC1.100-2014 [2020]) eliminates high-frequency sound (leaf rustle, equipment noise, and biologic sounds) allowing for more accurate comparisons of low-frequency ambient sound levels across different land use types (e.g., urban, protected areas; ASA/ANSI S3/SC1.100-2014 [2020]). This frequency weighting scheme improves ambient sound level measurements in quiet environments. For instance, in the full frequency range, the 35 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~) level was exceeded at **~`r (pcode)`00X 16.74 %** of the time during the day and **~3.31 %** of the time at night, **~but in the 20 – 1,250 Hz range, the 35 dB functional sound level value was very rarely exceeded in daytime or nighttime**. Speech interruption (between two people 1 meter apart) occurs at 60 dB (~LAeq,~~1s~) and this level was rarely exceeded at any of the sites. 

After data collection was complete, trained technicians calculated how often noise sources were audible. See Methods section for protocol details, equipment specifications, and metrics calculations. Sound source analysis revealed that noise was audible about **~7 – 85 % **of the time during the sampling period at study sites when averaged across all hours of the day (Table 3). The most common noise sources observed during this study were **~aircraft and vehicles**. Natural sources such as **~wind, rain, thunder, coyotes, songbirds, and insects were also commonly audible.** Natural ambient sound levels (L~Anat~) ranged between **~16.4 – 30.0 dB** during the day and **~15.1 – 33.0** dB at night. Increased natural ambient sound levels during day and night varied by location and were likely caused by diurnal winds and site-specific insect and bird activity.

Introduction
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
A 1998 survey of the American public revealed that 72 percent of respondents thought that providing opportunities to experience natural quiet and the sounds of nature was a very important reason for having national parks, while another 23 percent thought that it was somewhat important (Haas & Wakefield 1998). In another survey specific to park visitors, 91 percent of respondents considered enjoyment of natural quiet and the sounds of nature as compelling reasons for visiting national parks (McDonald et al. 1995). Acoustic monitoring provides a scientific basis for assessing the status of acoustic resources, identifying trends in resource conditions, quantifying impacts from other actions, assessing consistency with park management objectives and standards, and informing management decisions regarding desired future conditions. 
National Park Service Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division 

The Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD) helps parks manage sounds in a way that protects park resources and the visitor experience. The NSNSD addresses acoustic issues raised by Congress, NPS Management Policies, and NPS Director’s Orders. The NSNSD works to protect, maintain, or restore acoustic environments throughout the National Park System. Its goal is to provide coordination, guidance, and a consistent approach to soundscape protection with respect to park resources and visitor use. The program also provides technical assistance to parks in the form of acoustic monitoring, data processing, park planning support, and comparative analyses of acoustic environments. 
Soundscape Planning Authorities 

The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 states that the purpose of national parks is "… to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." In addition to the NPS Organic Act, the Redwoods Act of 1978 affirmed that, "the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress." 
NPS Management Policies 2006 Chapter 4.9 provides direction for management of natural soundscapes: 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal quotation"}
“The National Park Service will preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the natural soundscapes of parks…

“The Service will restore to the natural condition wherever possible those park soundscapes that have become degraded by unnatural sounds (noise) and will protect natural soundscapes from unacceptable impacts.

“Using appropriate management planning, superintendents will identify what levels and types of unnatural sound constitute acceptable impacts on park natural soundscapes. The frequencies, magnitudes, and durations of acceptable levels of unnatural sound will vary throughout a park, being generally greater in developed areas. In and adjacent to parks, the Service will monitor human activities that generate noise that adversely affects park soundscapes [acoustic resources], including noise caused by mechanical or electronic devices. The Service will take action to prevent or minimize all noise that through frequency, magnitude, or duration adversely affects the natural soundscape [acoustic resource] or other park resources or values, or that exceeds levels that have been identified through monitoring as being acceptable to or appropriate for visitor uses at the sites being monitored” (NPS 2006a)." 
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
It should be noted that under Management Policies 2006 Chapter 8.2.3, “[t]he natural ambient sound level—that is, the environment of sound that exists in the absence of human-caused noise—is the baseline condition, and the standard against which current conditions in a soundscape [acoustic resource] will be measured and evaluated” (NPS 2006c). However, the desired acoustic condition may also depend upon the resources and the values of the park. For instance, “culturally appropriate sounds are important elements of the national park experience in many parks” (NPS 2006b). In this case, “the Service will preserve soundscape resources and values of the parks to the greatest extent possible to protect opportunities for appropriate transmission of cultural and historic sounds that are fundamental components of the purposes and values for which the parks were established” (NPS 2006b). 

Further guidance is provided in Management Policies 2006 §4.1.4 Partnerships, §4.1.5 Restoration of Natural Systems, §8.2 Visitor Use, §8.2.2 Recreational Activities, §8.2.3 Use of Motorized Equipment, and §8.4 Overflights and Aviation Uses (NPS 2006). 

Director’s Order 47, Soundscape Preservation and Noise Management (2000) builds on the principles set out in Management Policies, directing park management how and when to consider acoustic resources. Through this order, parks are guided to manage noise by: identifying noise sources, minimizing noise from park operations, considering the acoustic environment in park planning documents, and promoting park sounds and noise management through communication, education, and outreach.

Focal Park Unit 
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
`r (park)` (`r (pcode)`) **(~EXAMPLE/USE LANGUAGE IN RSSs/FOUNDATION DOCUMENTS/ETC. protects a vast “weird and scenic landscape” with remarkable and diverse volcanic features, sagebrush steppe ecosystems, and wilderness, which provides opportunities to explore, understand, and value the rugged and remote high desert landscape of the Great Rift Region (NPS 2014). The `r (pcode)` Foundation Document identifies Wilderness Character as a Fundamental Resource Value and identifies highway traffic impacts to the natural soundscape in Wilderness as an important issue for the park to strategically address (NPS 2014). Furthermore, the `r (pcode)` Resource Stewardship Strategy (RSS) identified the Natural Soundscape as a priority resource (NPS 2018). A high priority stewardship activity included collecting baseline acoustic data, which resulted in a Technical Assistance request to NSNSD in 2017 (TAR 4881). This study describes the outcome of that request.)**

This report covers results from an acoustic inventory conducted from `r (datayear1)` **to `r (datayear2)`** at `r (pcode)` (**~Table X)**. `r (sitenumword)` sites were selected to represent a range of visitation, noise source, and habitat type. **~One site was deployed during two sampling visits (`r (pcode)`00X). Two sites were deployed only during the first visit (`r (pcode)`00X, `r (pcode)`00X), and three sites were deployed only during the second visit (`r (pcode)`00X – 00X). Four of the sites were deployed in the northern half of the unit, which also receives the most visitation. Two of the sites were deployed in the southern portion of the unit. The set of acoustic inventory sites spanned 130 km. (Figure 1).**

Methods

Automatic Monitoring 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
A Larson Davis sound level meter (SLM) type 831-A was deployed at `r (sitenumword)` monitoring **~site(s)**. The SLM is a hardware-based, real-time analyzer which constantly records one-third octave band sound pressure level (SPL) data. This Larson Davis-based site met American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type 1 standards (ANSI 1968 [R2020], 1983 [R2006], 1992 [2018]) for accurate survey-grade instrumentation. The sound level meter provided the information needed to calculate metrics described below in Calculation of Metrics. 

Acoustic monitoring equipment is used by many practitioners to determine noise levels in different environments, both indoors and outdoors. The NPS uses equipment like that used by other practitioners but has developed a unique configuration that stands up to the potentially harsh environment encountered in national parks (National Park Service 2013). The microphone with environmental shroud was set up on a tripod at 1.5 m above the ground, which approximates the average height of the human ear. The digital audio recorder recorded continuous audio through the entire monitoring period (see details below on the acoustic record). An anemometer was attached to a tripod and placed approximately 10 feet from the microphone to capture local wind conditions. 

The sampling station consisted of:

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
The sampling station was designed to collect: 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr List Bullet L1"}

  Flat-weighted, time-average sound level (L~Zeq,~~1s~) for each one-third octave frequency band, 12.5 – 20,000 Hz in dB re 20 µPa [collected by Type 1 sound level meter].
  
  A-weighted, time-average sound level (L~Aeq,~~1s~~[12.5~~–~~20000 Hz]~) in dB re 20 µPa [collected by Type 1 sound level meter].
  
  Continuous meteorological data for wind speed [collected by anemometer].
  
  Continuous digital audio recordings.

:::

:::{custom-style="sr Heading 2"}
Monitoring Period 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
It is typical to monitor a minimum of 25 days to capture daily differences within a sampling period that occur at each site within a reasonable margin of error (NPS 2005). For this study, the monitoring period ranged from **~43 to 84 days. **
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Heading 2"}
Calculation of Metrics 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
The status of the acoustical environment can be characterized by sound level (L~A50~, L~Anat~, L~A90~, L~A10~, L~Aeq~) and frequency content, and event durations (through off-site listening). NPS uses descriptive figures and metrics to interpret these characteristics.

Two fundamental descriptors are existing ambient (L~A50~) and natural ambient (L~Anat~) sound levels. These are both examples of percentile levels, where each L~x~ value refers to the sound level that is exceeded x % of the time. The L~A50~ represents the median sound level and is drawn from a full dataset (removing data with wind speed > 5m/s to eliminate error from microphone distortion). The L~A50~ is the preferred metric to represent prevailing acoustic conditions. The natural ambient (L~Anat~) is an estimate of what the sound levels for a site would be if all human-caused noise sources were removed. L~Anat~ is the preferred metric to represent baseline or reference conditions. 

For a given hour (or other specified time period), L~Anat~ is calculated to be the sound level exceeded x percent of the time, where x is defined by equation (1): 
:::
```{r equation, echo=FALSE,out.width = '30%',ft.align="center"}
# Include the image of the LNAT equation
include_graphics(paste(park.image.folder,"lnatequation.png",sep=""))

```

:::{custom-style="sr Alternate text"}
The natural ambient sound level equals one hundred minus the percentage of samples containing noise for a given hour divided by two, plus the percentage of samples containing noise for that same hour.  
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
where
P~H~ = percentage of samples containing noise for the hour.

For example, if human caused sounds are present 30% of the hour, x = 65, and the L~Anat~ is equal to the L~65~, or the level exceeded 65% of the time. To summarize and display these data, the median of the hourly L~Anat~ values for the daytime hours (0700 – 1900) and the median of the hourly L~Anat~ values for the nighttime (1900-0700) are displayed in graphical format in the following sections.

Off-Site Listening and Spectrogram Analysis
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Heading 2"}
Listening Center Software Analysis **(DELETE SECTION OF NO LISTENING CENTER ANALYSIS COMPLETED)**
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
Off-site analysis is completed by listening to the audio record while simultaneously viewing its spectrogram representation (for more information on Listening Center software, see Appendix A). Auditory analysis was used to calculate the audibility of sound sources at each location. Trained technicians at Colorado State University (Figure 2) listened back to **~9-11** days of the audio record. Technicians considered only a subsample of each day representing the first 10 seconds of every two-minute period. Within each subsample every audible sound source was categorized. This allowed the temporal extent of audibility for each source type to be estimated. The total percent time noise was audible was then used to calculate the natural ambient sound level (L~Anat~) for each hour (see Equation 1 above for more information). For any off-site audio playback listening techniques, Bose Quiet Comfort Noise Canceling headphones were used to minimize limitations imposed by the office acoustical environment.

Sound Pressure Level Annotation Tool **(DELETE SECTION OF NO LISTENING CENTER ANALYSIS COMPLETED)**
:::
:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
Sound pressure level data was annotated visually across **~52** days of spectrograms using the NPS-developed software, Sound Pressure Level Annotation Tool (SPLAT). Trained technicians used SPLAT to draw bounding boxes at the beginning and end of noise events using visual cues from the sound pressure energy, time, and frequency of a spectrogram (for more information on SPLAT software, see Appendix ~**X**). From the drawn bounding boxes, noise event counts (i.e., the number of boxes), and noise duration (i.e., the length of each box) were obtained. In addition, the noise-free interval (NFI) metric was generated. The NFI represents the length of time that passes between the end of one noise event and the beginning of the next. Over a longer sampling period, the median of NFI can describe how a typical opportunity for solitude has been fragmented by noise (Poling and Betchkal 2023). Like the Listening Center software, the total percent time noise was audible was then used to calculate the natural ambient sound level (L~Anat~) for each hour. 
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Heading 2"}
On-Site Listening **(DELETE SECTION OF NO LISTENING CENTER ANALYSIS COMPLETED)**
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
In addition to sound pressure level and audio data, knowledge of the type, context, duration, and distribution of sound sources is crucial for characterizing natural and non-natural acoustic conditions. This information can be acquired during periods of observer data collection, called on-site listening. During an on-site listening session, one inconspicuously listens to the soundscape and takes note of all audible events as they occur. For this technique, an observer sits quietly at a location at least 15 m from the acoustic monitor for one hour. At the top of the hour and once the observer is acclimated to the listening area, each sound heard is entered into a handheld device. Sound type, event count, and event duration are calculated from these sessions.

Frequency content
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
To determine the effect that noise has on the acoustic environment, it is useful to examine percentile metrics across a frequency range. High frequency sounds (such as a cricket chirping) and low frequency sounds (such as flowing water) often occur simultaneously, so the frequency spectrum is split into 33 narrower bands, each encompassing one-third of an octave. These narrow bands closely represent how humans distinguish between frequencies of sound. The percentile sound levels for 33 one-third octave band frequencies over the day and night periods are shown in **~Figure X – Figure X.** 

Examining the sound energy in each one-third octave band (combined with digital audio recordings) allows acoustic technicians to determine what types of sounds are contributing to the overall sound levels at a site. The grayed areas of ~**Figure X – Figure X** represent sound levels outside of the typical range of human hearing. The percentile levels (L~x~) are also shown for each one-third octave band. They represent the sound levels exceeded x  percent of the measurement period. For example, L~90~ is the sound level that has been exceeded 90% of the time, and only the quietest 10% of the samples can be found below this point. On the other hand, the L~10~ is the sound level that has been exceeded 10% of the time, and 90% of the measurements are quieter than the L~10~. The bold portion of the column represents the difference between L~50~ and L~nat~. The height of this bold portion is a measure of the contribution of anthropogenic noise to the existing sound levels at this site. The size of this portion of the column is directly related to the percent time that human caused sounds are audible. When bold portions of the column do not appear the natural and existing sound levels were either very close to each other or were equal. The typical frequency levels for transportation, conversation, and songbirds are presented on the figure as examples for interpretation of the data. These ranges are estimates and are not vehicle-, species-, or habitat-specific.

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
To understand how acoustic conditions in the park might affect visitors, measured sound levels are compared to sound levels of interest. Specifically, Table 5 reports the percent of time that measured sound levels (L~Aeq,~~1s~) were above four key functional effect levels during the monitoring periods (daytime and nighttime). The top value in each split-cell uses the full frequency range, whereas the bottom values report the percentage of the sample that ANS-weighted sound levels (20 – 1,250 Hz) were above functional effect thresholds. Most motorized human-caused noise is confined to the truncated, lower-frequency range, while many natural sounds, including insects and birds, are higher in pitch. ANS weighting eliminates high-frequency sound (leaf rustle, and biologic sounds) allowing for more accurate comparisons of low-frequency ambient sound levels across different land use types (e.g. urban, protected areas; ANSI S3/SC1.100, 2014 [R2020]). This frequency weighting scheme improves ambient sound level measurements in quiet environments.

The first functional effect in ~**Table 5** occurs around 35 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), which is designed to address the health effects of sleep interruption. Studies suggest that sound events as low as 35 dB can have adverse effects on blood pressure in sleeping humans (Haralabidis et al. 2008). This is also the desired background sound level in classrooms (ANSI S12.60-2002 [R2012]). For application to the present study, the 35 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~) effect level was exceeded at ~**`r (pcode)`00X 16.74 %** of the time during the day and **~3.31 %** of the time at night in the full frequency range. In the 20 – 1,250 Hz range, the 35 dB functional sound level value **~was very rarely exceeded in daytime or nighttime.** The second functional effect is expected to occur around 45 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~). It addresses the World Health Organization’s recommendations that noise levels inside bedrooms remain below 45 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~) (Berglund et al. 1999). The third functional effect is expected to occur around 52 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), based on the EPA’s speech interference threshold for speaking in a raised voice to an audience at 10 meters (EPA 1974). This threshold addresses the effects of sound on interpretive presentations in parks. The final functional effect at 60 dB (LAeq,1s), provides a basis for estimating impacts on normal voice communications at 1 meter. Visitors viewing scenic areas in the park regularly conduct such conversations.

Sound Level: Percentile Levels
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
To understand the range of acoustic conditions at the park, percentile sound levels are reported (**~Table X, Figure X – Figure XX, Table X).** In **~Figure 9,** the A-weighted percentile sound levels (L~A90~, L~Anat~, L~A50~, and L~A10~) for **~`r (pcode)`00X** are shown. The hourly percentile sound levels are calculated from the broadband (12.5 Hz – 20 kHz) A-weighted, 1-second time averaged sound levels (L~Aeq,~~1s~) within each hour of the day. For instance, in **~Figure 9**, the L~A50~ (median) sound level for **~`r (pcode)`00X** during the **~8:00 hour is 19.1 dB**. On the other hand, the sound level exceeded 10% of the time (L~A10~) for the same hour at this site is **~26.6** dB, meaning 90% of the measurement period is quieter. Hours where the L~A50~ and the L~Anat~ differ the most are usually hours with the most human-caused noise, as shown with site **~`r (pcode)`00X (Figure X)**. The larger the span of the black bars, the greater the difference of the existing sound level from natural conditions. At **~`r (pcode)`00X, existing sound levels are closest to natural conditions in the early morning hours but depart from natural conditions for most of the day (Figure X). In general, higher natural ambient sound levels occurred in the late evening and early morning hours and are largely due to insect and bird activity (Figures X – X).**

Conclusions
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
Noise has the potential to affect a visitor’s experience in parks by causing annoyance (Rapoza et al. 2015), reducing the perceived scenic beauty (Weinzimmer et al. 2014) and tranquility (Watts et al. 2020), and by limiting opportunities for solitude or a wilderness experience at this park. Increased sound levels may also have wide ranging effects on wildlife such as reduced predatory success (Mason 2015), changes in vocal communication, and increased vigilance by keystone species (Shannon et al. 2014). In a review of literature addressing the effects of noise on wildlife published between 1990 and 2013, wildlife responses to noise were observed beginning at about 40 dB (L~Aeq~, as a composite of multiple metrics with varying time-averaging). Of the papers reviewed, 20% showed impacts to terrestrial wildlife at or below noise levels of 50 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~) (Shannon et al. 2016).

This study arose from a technical assistance request from `r (pcode)`, which identified the need to improve understanding of the park’s acoustic environment. **~Soundscape data were identified as a need to document baseline conditions and to help evaluate threats from encroaching development.** Acoustic measurements allow parks to gain insight into levels of extrinsic noise and biological activity. The results can help estimate the effects of noise on park visitors and wildlife, as well as the condition of the acoustic environment.

To carry out this study, `r (sitenum)` monitoring sites were placed in distinct areas of the monument that captured varied noise levels, sources, and patterns that exist across `r (pcode)`. Results included measures of existing ambient sound levels, calculations of sound source audibility through off-site listening, and estimates of natural ambient sound levels **~(add additional metrics if needed)**. 


At **~`r (pcode)`00X, functional effect thresholds were exceeded at the most sensitive sound threshold, 35 dB (L~Aeq,~~1s~), 33% of the day and 8 %** of the night in the ANS-weighted frequency ranges **~(Table X)**.  These results are like those in the full frequency range, which indicates that most of the sound energy contributing to this threshold is from lower frequency noise sources. Sound levels at this site were measured higher than **~`r (pcode)`00X, and existing median sound levels (L~A50~) were ~5.1** dB higher than natural sound levels (L~Anat~) during the day and **~4.3** dB higher at night **~(Table X)**. Off-site listening in a subset of data revealed that noise was audible nearly **~100 % of each hour, every day (Figure X)**. The primary noise source was coded as **~ “Vehicles”, a source that is not surprising given the proximity of this site to suburban infrastructure. The second most common source was coded as “People”, which followed activity patterns of a typical human work day (Figure X).** In addition, gunshots were commonly audible from **~7:00 – 16:00, peaking at 30 – 40 % of each hour from 10:00 – 13:00 (Pennsylvania State University XXXX).  Gunshots audible from this site are from a firing range within 1.5 miles to the northwest. Of the two sites, `r (pcode)`00X had the highest natural sound level. The energetic contributions to natural sound levels at the site were from wind and birds (Pennsylvania State University XXXX).** 

**~COPY PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH FOR ALL `r (sitenum)` SITES**

**~Example text if %noise audibility >70% (then delete this!):**~As previously noted, this study reports L~Anat~ despite location specific conditions that partially reduce the accuracy of the sound level calculation. Baseline natural sound levels rely on less frequent noise (target of < 70% audibility) than what exists in `r (pcode)`. Because noise was audible for XX% of the day at `r (pcode)`00X and 77% of the day `r (pcode)`00X, the L~Anat~ reported likely has a higher margin of error than actual baseline conditions. To supplement the measured L~Anat~ results, Appendix C includes modeled sound levels and suggests that the median modeled whole-park noise impact is X.X dBA greater than the measured noise impact. For long acoustic records with many repeated values (e.g., at the natural ambient sound level) percentiles offer robust estimates of sound level (Tang and Phillips 2016). However, prevalent noise at TUSK severely censors observations of LAnat and suggests these reported figures overestimate the actual value.**

**~Example:**Based on the results of this study, visitors to `r (pcode)` likely experience noise throughout their visit. In general, noise at all sites is present during daytime and nighttime hours. The location of `r (pcode)` in relation to busy roads, suburban development, and a firing range contributed to the presence of noise at most hours.  

**~Example:**Finally, in addition to noise, natural sounds from wildlife were audible in the park. Dawn and dusk bird choruses were weak at both sites, and coyotes were the only other common audible animal sound. The lack of animal-derived natural sounds is likely due to monitoring during the winter. Further acoustic analysis, such as artificial intelligence techniques like BirdNET, could generate species lists and daily call patterns from this dataset. In fact, NSNSD worked on another TAR that deployed this technology with acoustic monitoring over multiple seasons and provided unverified bird species information back to `r (pcode)` **UPDATE LINK(https://irma.nps.gov/STAR/Summary/Edit/32069).** 

The information presented in this report will be used to inform park managers and planners, and it will also serve as a permanent record of what the park sounded like in the winter of 2019 - 2020. Sound level data as well as continuous digital audio recordings will be archived with the Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division office in Fort Collins, Colorado.

Appendix B: Modeled Impact Levels
:::

:::{custom-style="sr Normal"}
NSNSD developed a model (Mennitt et al. 2014, NPS 2021) that predicts the median sound level using measurements made in hundreds of national park sites as well as 109 explanatory variables such as location, climate, land cover, hydrology, wind speed, and proximity to noise sources such as roads, railroads, and airports. The resulting model can predict sound levels anywhere in the contiguous United States and estimate how much lower these sound levels would be in the absence of human activities. Each pixel in the graphic shown in Figures 5-7 represents 270 m and represents the acoustic conditions in a typical summer day.

Within `r (pcode)`, the model predicted an existing L~50~ of **~32.8 dBA** (Figure 5) and a natural L~50~ of **~23.5 dBA** (Figure 6). The modeled difference between the existing and predicted natural sound level (L~50~~impact~) at `r (pcode)` is shown in Figure 7 and provides a measure of how much anthropogenic noise is increasing the existing sound level above the natural sound level on an average summer day in the park. Across `r (pcode)`, the mean modeled sound level impact is **~9.1 dBA** (ranging from **~8.1 dBA** in the least impacted areas to **~9.7 dBA** in the most impacted areas). 

For translating sound level impacts into functional effects (for human visitors and resident wildlife), an increase in background sound level of 3 dB produces an approximate decrease in listening area of 50%. In other words, by raising the sound level at `r (pcode)` by just 3 dB, the ability of listeners to hear the sounds around them is effectively cut in half. Furthermore, an increase of 7 dB leads to an approximate decrease in listening area of 80%. An increase of **~9.1 dBA would reduce the listening area for wildlife and visitors by ~87.7%**. For example, if a predator can hear a potential prey animal in an area of 100 square feet in a setting with natural ambient sounds, that animal’s ability to hear would be reduced to **~22 square feet if the sound levels were increased by the modeled average impact of ~9.1 dBA.**

Figure `r(gsm_exist)`. Map of predicted existing acoustic levels in `r (park)` for an average summer day. The color scale indicates median (L~50~) sound pressure level (in A-weighted decibels, or dBA), with 270-meter resolution. In the map, the park boundary is displayed by a green polygon and fills the entire extent of the main map frame. A dark blue to light blue color gradient color scheme follows the range of predicted existing sound levels, from **~20.1 dBA to 67.0 dBA**. The darkest shade of blue indicates lower existing sound levels and the light blue indicate the highest existing sound levels. The modeled data predicts an L~50~ of **~26.0 dBA** for all `r (pcode)`, which results in a darker blue shade of color displayed.
